1. Each quiz is linked to its own Google Form response sheet.  
2. The script:
   - Extracts quiz scores and student IDs  
   - Matches them with the central grade sheet IDs  
   - Updates the correct quiz column with the latest scores  
3. A time-based trigger ensures the script runs **every Monday** without manual execution.
